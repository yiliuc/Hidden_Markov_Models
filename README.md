# Hidden Markov Models and Applications in Time Series Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains all the codes and analyzes of Hidden Markov Models and Applications in Time Series Analysis. This is also the final project of STAT929. This paper clearly explain the fundamental algorithms in HMMs, and provides two applications in Time Series. 

All the real worl data are stored in the folder `data`. The out put paper is `final_project.pdf`, which is knitted by `final_project.rmd`.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

- `codes` contains all the codes using in this paper.
- `data` contains all the real-world data.
- `final_project.pdf` is the paper.
- `final_project.rmd` is the raw rmd file of the paper.
